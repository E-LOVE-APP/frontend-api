# üíñ E-Love (Backend)

Welcome to **E-Love**! üéÆ‚ù§Ô∏è This app is designed to help young gamers who play online games like
Valorant and Dota meet new people and find meaningful relationships.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed for this backend service:

- Python Interpreter (version 3.10)
- Docker installed & Docker Desktop application
- Poetry
- Taskfile

### Why Use Poetry?

Poetry is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python. It provides a more comprehensive and user-friendly approach compared to pip,
by handling dependencies in a lock file, managing virtual environments, and simplifying the publishing process.

### Taskfile

Taskfile is a tool for defining and running project-specific tasks. It simplifies complex command sequences into simple task invocations.

To install Taskfile:

Install Taskfile using the official installation method - `https://taskfile.dev/`

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-love.git
   ```

---

IMPORTANT INFO

2nd and 3d parts below were automated by .vscode task-script. (doesn't work for now)
So please start our application in VSCODE from `frontend-api` folder.
If this task hasn't worked, please use the next steps below this section.
(FYI, composing containers task isn't included in the script)

---

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd e-love-frontend-api
   ```

3. Run dependencies installation & other stuff using Taskfile:

   ```sh
   poetry shell
   ```

   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```

   ```sh
   task compose-up
   ```

### Development

To run the app in development mode:

1. Open your Docker Desktop and search for e-love-frontend-api container.
